  Firefox
</h1>
<p>Firefox is wonderful.
It's important to have an alternative to the Chrome hegemony.
Mozilla, despite missteps, has done very valuable work for open-source software and even for a more open society.
I owe a great debt to all the wonderful open-source developers, especially any volunteers, who spend their time on such a complex project.
Firefox is wonderful.<br />
And yet, I am mad.

<ul>
<li><strong>Firefox cannot deal with updates gracefully</strong><br />
The crux of the issue is that when updating Firefox (my experience here is only about updating via a system package manager, such as Pacman on Arch) it will keep working <em>until you open a new page</em>;
once you open a new page it will <em>force</em> you, with an apologetic, placating &quot;we just need this eentsy-teentsy thing to keep going&quot;, to restart it.
It's really jarring when you <em>intentionally</em> did an update, and then it actually just all works, but then this one step of usage comes up eventually --- you already forgot about the update --- where suddenly youre jerked out of your workflow.
Used to be even worse, that (at least for me, under Arch Linux, i3wm) it just would not actually start again by itself.
üò†<div class=suggestion>My solution (just for myself as a single user) would be to either force an immediate restart or to be able to handle updates more gracefully, as Chrome does.</div>
</li>
<li><strong>Firefox loves closing <em>everything</em></strong><br />
This one really annoyed me today:
I have five or six firefox windows open, some of it is stuff I'm reading, some of it is a few YouTube tabs of music I mean to check out to have in the background for my work, some of it is work, and then I have a window just for a video conference.
The video conference ends and I close the window in my window manager, as I would do any other, with the shortcut <code>ALT+SHIFT+Q</code>.
<em>Every firefox window closes</em>.
<em>It's not possible to get any of those tabs back with <code>CTRL+SHIFT+T</code>, they're gone.</em>
<em>Huh?</em>
üò†</li>
</ul>
