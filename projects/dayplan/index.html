<p>Dayplan is a time planning and tracking tool I created.</p>
<p>If you want to see what it's about, probably best to just check out the <a href="https://github.com/ja-he/dayplan">GitHub repo</a>, but I'd like to emphasize here that I've been using this for far over a year, basically every day, very happily.</p>
<p>It especially feels quite good to have this data fully in my control;
when, for example, time tracking (via spreadsheets, mostly) became obligatory, it was quite easy to write a new subcommand <code>timesheet</code> to dump out all the data for a given time range, with some formatting directives, in a CSV format which was then already fit for Excel, or (even better) for piping into <code>ssconvert</code>.</p>
<p>I would encourage anybody who really likes working on the terminal and has an interest in time tracking to try out dayplan.
No worries if it's not your thing, and if you don't quite grok it at first, that's surely on me, I'm not really a UX engineer y'know? ü§∑</p>
