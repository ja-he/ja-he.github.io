</ul>
<p>This is a small C++ project where my initial goal was just to quickly get a palette from an image file.
Thanks to nothing's <em>wonderful</em> <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb">STB</a> I got to get started pretty quickly and just used the project to explore working with image data in C++.</p>
<p>Once I had a basic state where it would spit out however many colors I wanted I really only used it once to give me the color palette for my <a href="https://github.com/ja-he/kurzzug">kurzzug</a> colorscheme for Neovim.
After that this project sat neglected for a good while, until I thought I wanted to apply the k-Means clustering algorithm to it to have it actually produce good results.</p>
<p>It could probably do with a bit of cleanup to boil down the code to the essential bits, then it'd be a nice very-small-scale project that works quite well.</p>
