<p>This is a small Neovim extension for resolving Git conflicts.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Proofreading for a friend, I suddenly had a bunch of conflicts to deal with from my corrections on one branch clashing with some of the merged corrections on the main branch.
My process for resolving was straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy conflict in full</li>
<li>open new tab and do <code>:vnew</code>, such that I have two splits, side by side</li>
<li>paste the conflict such that one side on one side, other on the other (always took some manual editing to remove the markers and whatnot)</li>
<li>do <code>:windo diffthis</code>; this adds both splits to a diff list and basically just uses Vim's diff mode on the two splits, rather convenient</li>
<li>resolve the conflict (usually five lines or so) and copy the resolved version back in place of the initial conflict</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, this called for a plugin.
Since I was looking to learn more about hacking Neovim with its Lua interface, I was happy for the opportunity too, but so far I've only had time to get a basic version done;
probably good enough, but could be a bit nicer.</p>
